# Spring Boot Mail Management with using EWS Api 

Microsoftâ€™s Exchange Web Services (EWS) provides an Exchange email API that provides access to all of the data and functionality in Exchange mailboxes; it enables developers to parse email data, create email drafts, send emails, manage attachments, and organize an email inbox with folders. 

### Configure Mail Account
You can configure your mail account in application.properties or .env(for docker containerisation) in this project. 
* exchange.server.url=${EXCHANGE_SERVER_URL:https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx}
* exchange.server.domain=${EXCHANGE_SERVER_DOMAIN:} ``if your mail server has domain u need to enter it here. Outlook's ews doesn't need to use domain``
* exchange.mail.username=${EXCHANGE_MAIL_USERNAME:mailadress@hotmail.com} ``if your exchange server has username you need to use username instead of mail adress``
* exchange.mail.password=${EXCHANGE_MAIL_PASSWORD:????????}

### Run

* ``` mvn spring-boot:run ```

OR Run with docker containerisation.
* ``` ./build.sh ```
